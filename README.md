# NYC Rat Inspection Predictor

Project repo for model to predict future rat inspections in NYC by Tax Block.

Rat inspection data from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj) and tax lot information from the NYC Planning Department [PLUTO database](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page#pluto).

Visualization of historic rat inspections can be found on the project's [bl.ocks.org](https://bl.ocks.org/bgentry91/783ac5c3cc4fae6c952806d2465a8989) page. [Direct Link](https://bl.ocks.org/bgentry91/raw/783ac5c3cc4fae6c952806d2465a8989/)
